# Changelog — relay-node

All notable changes to the **relay-node** binary are documented here. This is a
SEPARATE changelog from `CHANGELOG.md` (which covers the panel + cross-cutting
features): panel and node release on independent version tracks (`node-vX.Y.Z`
tags vs panel `vX.Y.Z` tags), so each has its own history. A node release's
GitHub Release body is extracted from this file by
`scripts/extract-changelog.sh <version> CHANGELOG-NODE.md`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-23

Major Node release for the coordinated RelayPanel 1.2.11 rollout.

> **Coordinated upgrade required. Do not upgrade the Node alone in
> production.** Configuration protocol version 6 is an exact-match contract:
> Node 2.0.0 is not compatible with Panel 1.2.9, and Node 1.2.4 is not
> compatible with Panel 1.2.11. The intended release pair is **Panel 1.2.11 +
> Node 2.0.0**. Publish both artifacts before beginning a coordinated
> maintenance-window deployment.

### Breaking compatibility

- **Configuration protocol version increases from 4 to 6.** Listener
  configuration now carries explicit ingress and upstream descriptors, and
  health commands bind their WebSocket session and resource generation. The
  Panel and Node reject mismatched protocol versions with a fail-closed
  `426 Upgrade Required` path; the Node stops listeners rather than retaining
  forwarding behavior whose semantics can no longer be trusted.

### Added

- **SOCKS5 inbound forwarding**, with no-auth or username/password client
  authentication.
- **Explicit direct and SOCKS5 upstreams**, including remote-DNS support and
  fail-closed routing when credentials or endpoints are invalid.
- **Directed SOCKS5 health checks** with bounded concurrency and queue limits,
  plus queue-depth reporting for operational visibility.
- **Session- and generation-bound health commands** so reconnects and late
  results cannot mutate a newer resource state.
- **Stable traffic report identifiers** so retries after acknowledgement loss
  remain idempotent.

### Changed

- HTTP polling and reporting now use native TLS roots, matching the WSS control
  channel and supporting administrator-installed private certificate
  authorities consistently.
- A configuration-protocol mismatch stops active listeners and enters the
  permanent-error backoff path instead of continuing with stale forwarding
  semantics.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-09-08

Node only. Nothing on the wire changed (still protocol version 4), so this node
runs against any current panel — but the panel only records what it reports
from **1.2.9** onward.

Worth taking if you use the one-click remote upgrade.

### Added

- **A failed self-upgrade is reported to the panel instead of only the local
  log.** Everything that can go wrong in an upgrade goes wrong here — the
  download (routinely, where GitHub is unreachable), the sha256 check, the
  backup, the swap — and every one of those errors used to end at
  `tracing::error!` on a machine nobody is watching. The panel had sent the
  command and heard nothing since, so it could not tell a failed upgrade from a
  slow one, and said so in the audit log for want of anything better.

  The node now POSTs the reason to `/api/v1/node/upgrade_result`, authenticated
  with its existing node token.

  Only failures are reported, and the asymmetry is forced rather than chosen: a
  successful upgrade ends by exiting so the supervisor re-execs the new binary,
  so there is no process left to send a success — and none is needed, since the
  node comes back and reports its new version in the ordinary status report.

  Best-effort by construction: it runs on a path that is already broken, often
  because the network is down, so it gets a short timeout and its own failure is
  logged and dropped. The node keeps forwarding on the binary it still has.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-08-27

Node only. Nothing on the wire changed (still protocol version 4), so this
node runs against any current panel.

**Take this one if you bill by traffic.** Until now a long-lived connection was
not counted until it closed, so it could move any amount of traffic for free.

### Fixed

- **TCP traffic is counted while the connection is open.** Both copy paths
  summed bytes into a local and submitted them only when the copy loop ended —
  i.e. when the connection closed. A long-lived connection therefore
  contributed NOTHING to its rule's usage for as long as it stayed up.

  That is a billing hole, not a reporting delay. The panel stops forwarding by
  comparing reported usage against the plan quota, so a persistent connection —
  a tunnel, a VPN, a long download — could move any amount of traffic while its
  owner's quota still read zero, and nothing ever had a reason to stop it. The
  bytes landed in one lump whenever the connection finally ended, potentially
  long after the user stopped paying for them.

  Both the userspace copy and the Linux zero-copy (splice) path now report each
  chunk as it moves, so the unreported amount is never more than one in-flight
  buffer.

  The previous behaviour was documented as a known limitation; it is closer to
  a defect, and the documentation is updated with this release.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-08-13

Node only. Nothing on the wire changed — the config protocol stays at version
4, so this node runs against any current panel.

Worth taking if you run UDP rules with more than one target.

### Fixed

- **A UDP session now falls through to a standby when the primary target fails.**
  Only the first resolved target was ever attempted, so a target that refused
  the connection dropped the session's first datagram instead of trying the
  backups the rule configures.

- **A local bind failure is no longer blamed on the targets.** Binding the
  outbound socket happens once per session, before target selection. It fails
  when `OUTBOUND_BIND_IPV4` names an address the host no longer has — a NIC
  rename or a changed DHCP lease — which says nothing about any target's health.
  Attempting it per candidate reported that one local fault to the circuit
  breaker once per target and tripped all of them, and replaced the precise
  "failed to bind outbound" diagnostic with a message accusing the targets.

### Changed

- **Targets are resolved lazily**, one at a time as their turn comes, instead of
  all up front. This runs on the listener's receive loop for every new session,
  so a rule with three DNS targets and a healthy primary was paying three
  lookups where one would do — and stalling the whole port on a cold cache for
  two standbys it never used.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-02

Node only. Nothing on the wire changed — the config protocol stays at version
4, so this node runs against any current panel, and upgrading is optional
unless the node sits somewhere `api.ipify.org` cannot be reached.

### Changed

- **Public-IP detection no longer uses ipify.** `api.ipify.org` is unreachable
  from mainland China, so on a node there the probe timed out every 30 minutes
  forever and the panel showed no address for it — and therefore no country
  flag and no region — while the node was otherwise perfectly online. The
  defaults are now `api-ipv4.ip.sb` / `api-ipv6.ip.sb`, which answer from both
  sides.

  Both defaults must stay **family-pinned**, and a test now enforces it. The two
  probes validate the address family and discard a mismatch, so a dual-stack
  endpoint — one that replies with whichever family the connection happened to
  use — makes the IPv4 probe intermittently throw its answer away. That failure
  appears only on dual-stack hosts and only sometimes, which is why it is worth
  a test rather than a comment.

  Existing nodes keep working unchanged and can be fixed without upgrading, by
  setting `PUBLIC_IPV4_CHECK_URL` in `/opt/relay-node/relay-node.env` and
  restarting. The installer now writes both variables as commented examples.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **`restart_rule` control message.** The panel can ask the node to drop one
  rule's connections and rebuild its listeners. The node re-creates listeners
  from its OWN cached config (`ForwarderManager::last_config`), never from
  anything in the message, so a restart cannot be used to inject listener
  config. `node_id` is re-checked on arrival as defence in depth even though
  `send_node` already routed it.

  The WS dispatch arm for this MUST stay above the diagnose arm and MUST check
  `type`: `DiagnoseRuleMessage` defaults its `challenge` field and ignores
  unknown fields, so a `restart_rule` payload deserializes into it cleanly
  (`rule_id` + `request_id` are both present). Ordered after diagnose, every
  restart would silently become a target probe instead. A test in
  `relay-shared` pins the ambiguity.

- **Per-rule concurrent TCP connection cap** (`ListenerConfig.max_connections`,
  None = unlimited). Admission happens in the accept loop, not in the spawned
  connection task: the accept loop is sequential, so check-then-increment there
  is exact, whereas incrementing inside the task would let an unbounded number
  of accepts through before the first increment landed — precisely the
  connection-flood case the cap exists for. Over the cap, the socket is dropped
  immediately (the "at cap" warning is rate-limited to once per 60s per
  listener; a rule sitting at its cap rejects on every accept, and an
  unthrottled warn would itself become the outage).

  The counter lives per RULE, not per listener: a dual-stack rule runs two
  accept loops (IPv4 + IPv6), and a per-listener counter would silently grant
  double the configured cap.

### Fixed

- **Aborting a listener no longer leaves its connections forwarding.**
  Connections run on detached `tokio::spawn` tasks, so an aborted accept loop
  stopped new accepts while every established connection kept relaying —
  verified: a post-abort read/write round-trips fine. Connections now select on
  a per-rule cancellation channel (`forwarder::gate`). Consequences:
  - an explicit `restart_rule` genuinely sheds connections rather than just
    re-binding the port;
  - a rule removed from the node's config now stops forwarding, instead of
    relaying bytes for a rule whose traffic counters `apply_config` already
    pruned.

  `apply_config`'s fingerprint-driven restart (changed targets / rate caps) does
  NOT cancel: editing a rule must not kick everyone off, which has been the
  behaviour since v0.3.6.

- **A UDP-only rule's restart is no longer a silent no-op.** `restart_rule`
  returned early when the rule had no `RuleRuntime` — but only the TCP arm of
  `apply_config` creates one (UDP has no `accept()` and no cancellable
  per-connection tasks), so a UDP-only rule has no runtime while very much
  having a listener. It was never torn down or rebuilt, and its sessions never
  dropped. The panel reports success as soon as the command reaches the node, so
  the operator was told the rule had restarted while nothing happened at all.
  "No runtime" now means only "no connections to cancel"; whether there are
  listeners to rebuild is decided separately.

### Compatibility

- Requires panel **1.2.0+** to be sent `restart_rule` or a connection cap. Both
  additions are backward compatible on the wire (`#[serde(default)]`), so a
  1.2.0 node runs against an older panel unchanged — it simply never receives
  either.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **UDP forwarding now follows DDNS target IP changes.** A UDP rule's domain
  target was resolved ONCE when the listener started (rule push / node boot) and
  the resolved IP was reused forever — so a DDNS target (WireGuard, game relay,
  DNS forwarding) that changed IP kept getting blackholed to the stale address
  until the rule or node was manually restarted. New UDP sessions now resolve
  through the shared 30s DNS cache (same as TCP), so an IP change is picked up
  within the cache TTL; established sessions age out on the 60s idle timeout and
  the next datagram opens a fresh session against the current IP. This also
  removes the old "unresolvable-at-boot kills the listener → restart loop"
  behavior — a transient DNS failure no longer tears down the UDP listener.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **File-descriptor exhaustion under connection churn.** Forwarded TCP sockets
  (both the accepted client side and the dialed target side) now enable TCP
  keepalive (idle 60s, 15s probes, 4 retries). Previously a peer that vanished
  without a FIN/RST — NAT rebind, mobile handoff, cable pull, a firewall that
  drops instead of resets — left the bidirectional copy blocked on `read()`
  forever, holding two fds; under churn these dead half-open connections
  accumulated until the node hit `EMFILE` ("Too many open files", os error 24),
  even at `LimitNOFILE=65536`. Keepalive lets the kernel reap dead peers so the
  copy task ends and releases its fds.
- **Low fd limit on non-systemd launches.** The node now raises its own
  `RLIMIT_NOFILE` soft limit toward the hard limit at startup, so a docker or
  manual (bash/nohup) launch — which inherits the 1024 default instead of the
  systemd unit's `LimitNOFILE=65536` — no longer exhausts descriptors under
  moderate load. The node Docker Compose service also sets `ulimits.nofile` to
  65536 to match.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-02

The node half of the **one-click remote upgrade** release. (Panel-side changes
for the same feature are in `CHANGELOG.md` under [1.1.0].)

### Added

- **Self-upgrade.** On receiving a directed `upgrade_node` command over the WS
  control channel, a systemd node downloads the official `relay-node` release
  for its architecture from the GitHub release, **verifies the published
  sha256**, backs up its current binary, atomically swaps, and exits so systemd
  restarts it. Safety:
  - **Upgrade-only:** the target must be a valid semver strictly newer than the
    running version, so a compromised panel can't force a downgrade.
  - **Install-aware:** only systemd nodes self-upgrade; docker nodes are told to
    update the image, and manual runs are disabled (nothing would restart them).
  - **Single-flight + mandatory backup:** repeated commands can't corrupt the
    binary, and a failed backup aborts the swap.
- Binaries continue to ship for both **amd64 and arm64** (static musl + rustls).

### Notes

- Assets for 1.1.0 and earlier were published under the joint `v*` tag (panel
  and node shared a release). From 1.1.1 onward, node binaries publish under the
  dedicated `node-v*` tag. The node's self-upgrade download logic falls back to
  the `v*` URL for versions ≤ 1.1.0 so existing 1.1.0 nodes can still reach the
  historical asset; newer versions use `node-v*` exclusively.

---

_The node has no code, forwarding, protocol, or dependency changes in this
round, so no newer `node-v*` version is cut. A node release is only tagged when
something node-side actually changed._
